# Ensemble Learning in Machine Learning ðŸ¤–ðŸ“Š

Welcome to the Ensemble Learning Playground! ðŸš€ In this repository, we dive into the fascinating world of combining models for more robust predictions. 

## Overview

Ensemble Learning is like having a dream team of models, where they work together to bring out the best in each other. From Voting Classifiers to Boosting techniques, we've got it all covered. ðŸŒŸ

## Key Concepts

### 1. Voting Classifier
- Majority rules for classification, averages for regression.
- Heterogeneous mix of models.

### 2. Bagging Classifier
- Bootstrap + Aggregation = Powerful parallel learning.
- Random Forest is the superstar here!

### 3. Stacking
- Taking collaboration to the next level with base models and a meta-model.
- Heterogeneous ensemble at its finest.

### 4. Boosting
- Sequential learning with models improving from each other's mistakes.
- Meet AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, and XGBoost.
